        "\"So many people are afraid of snakes! Snakes are creepy, slimy, and scary! And they're also dangerous! People are always running away from them, screaming, 'Run, run, run!' I mean, come on! Why do people have to be scared of snakes? What's wrong with snakes?! They're not that scary! Sure, they might bite you, but it's probably going to hurt a lot less than getting hit by a car. So what if they have fangs? You should be grateful that they don't have claws! So, please, stop being afraid of snakes! If you're afraid of snakes, then you're a coward! Cowards are the scariest people of all! And you don't want to be a coward, do you?\"",
        "\"So what if I'm a little bit shorter than most people? I'm still tall enough to reach the top shelf! And that's good enough for me!\"",
        "\"So, uh, yeah... I don't really know what to say.\"",
        "\"Soggy bread is the worst! Why does it have to be soggy? Why can't it stay dry? What's wrong with it? I don't get it! Bread should never get wet!\"",

        "\"Sometimes, I see people who are really good at drawing, and I'm like, \"Wow! I wish I could draw like that!\" Then I remember that I'm not an artist, and I feel better!\"",
        "\"Sometimes, I think that I'm too shy. But then I realize that I'm not! I'm just trying to hide how awesome I really am!\"",
        "\"Special thanks to Salem and Victuracor.\"",
        "\"Sunglow and Moonfox are my favorite couple.\"",

        "\"The truth is, Ingo was a terrible writer. He was so bad at making secrets that he had to resort to using an AI to help him. His secret generator wasn't very good, though, because it kept giving him secrets that were way too boring. The secrets that it gave him were so uninteresting that they made Ingo's own secrets seem like masterpieces by comparison.\"",
        "\"There are two types of people in the world: people who like secrets, and people who don't. I happen to be one of the people who likes secrets! So, you know what? I'm going to write a bunch of secrets, and then I'm going to post them all over the internet! That way, everyone will see my secrets, and they'll be impressed! I bet it will be really cool!\"",
        "\"There are two types of people in the world: those who like eggs, and those who are wrong! Ha ha! Eggs are awesome!\"",
        "\"There's nothing more annoying than when someone says, \"I'll never be like you! I'll never be a furry!\" And then they turn out to be a furry! I mean, c'mon! Don't lie to yourself! You know you want a tail!\"",
        "\"This is the only secret that matters! All of the other secrets are just fluff! This one is the real deal! Take my word for it!\"",

        "\"What if we had a furry version of \"Jeopardy!\"? It would be so awesome! You know what I mean? People would dress up as their fursonas, and they'd answer questions about furs! It would be so cool!\"",
        "\"What if we took all of the secrets, and we made them into a story? That would be so cool! Imagine how great it would be to read a story that's full of secrets! It would be so awesome! I bet it would take you hours to read! Hours!\"",

        "\"Who would use Word Art for secrets? Nobody! That's who! It's totally useless! Why would anyone waste their time using Word Art for something as important as secrets? Think about it! It's crazy!\"",
        "\"Whoa there! You're going a little overboard with the eggs, aren't you?\"",
        "\"Whoa! I just realized something! I forgot to add a secret here! Dang it! Well, I guess I'll go ahead and put in a placeholder secret for now! I'll fix it later!\"",
        "\"Whoa! Look at all these secrets! My secret collection is getting bigger and bigger!\"",
        "\"Why are there no programming languages with eggs? I mean, it seems like a missed opportunity! We should invent a language that uses eggs! It would be AWESOME!\"",
